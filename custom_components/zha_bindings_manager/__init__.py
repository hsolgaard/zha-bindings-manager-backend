"""ZHA Bindings Manager Backend — optional persistent storage for the
zha-binding-map-card Lovelace card.

Installing this integration doesn't change anything on its own — it just
makes a storage backend available. The card detects it (via
get_capabilities) and, from that point, offers to save its data here
instead of (or in addition to) the browser's local storage, so it
survives across browsers/devices rather than being stuck in just one.
Removing this integration doesn't delete anything the card already saved
locally; the card falls back to local storage automatically the next time
it loads and finds the backend gone.
